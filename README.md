>Added a README.md file

When we add a a repository make sure to add a file named README.md where yu can write description about the file in a reader friendly format with headings and images, for that you will have to learn markdown which is similar to html, we use tags to give formatting to our text. watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUBNt18RFbo if you wanna learn about it.
